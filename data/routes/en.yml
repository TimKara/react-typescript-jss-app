# This is a route layout definition.
# The route definition defines which Sitecore components are present on a route,
# what their content data is, and which _placeholder_ they are placed in.

# This particular route definition is for the home route - '/', so it defines the
# components shown on the initial page of the app.

# You may use equivalent JSON files instead of YAML if you prefer;
# however YAML is simpler to read and allows comments like this one :)

# Setting an ID is optional, but it will allow referring to this item in internal links
# the ID can be a app-wide-unique string, or a GUID value.
id: home-page

# Route-level fields are appropriate for page level data like <title> contents
# Define route level fields in /sitecore/definitions/routes.sitecore
fields:
  pageTitle: Welcome to Sitecore JSS
# Define the page layout starting at the root placeholder - in this case, 'jss-main'
# root placeholder names are defined in the package.json config section (required for Sitecore deployment)

                    Thanks for using Umbrella for Sitecore JSS. Here are some resources to get you started:

                    ### [JSS Documentation](https://jss.sitecore.net)
                    The official JSS documentation can help you with any JSS task from getting started to advanced techniques.

                    ### [Umbrella](/umbrella)
                    Umbrella for Sitecore JSS is our vision on how a website should be developed and hosted while using the JSS SDK and Sitecore as a headless CMS.
                    
                    ### [Styleguide](/styleguide)
                    The JSS styleguide is a living example of how to use JSS, hosted right in this app.
                    It demonstrates most of the common patterns that JSS implementations may need to use,
                    as well as useful architectural patterns.

                    ### [GraphQL](/graphql)
                    JSS features integration with the Sitecore GraphQL API to enable fetching non-route data from Sitecore - or from other internal backends as an API aggregator or proxy.
                    This route is a living example of how to use an integrate with GraphQL data in a JSS app.

                    ## This app is a boilerplate
                    The JSS samples are a boilerplate, not a library. That means that any code in this app is meant for you to own and customize to your own requirements.
                    
                    Want to get change the lint settings? Do it. Want to read manifest data from a MongoDB database? Go for it. This app is yours.

                    ## How to start with an empty app
                    To remove all of the default sample content (the Umbrella, Styleguide and GraphQL routes) and start out with an empty JSS app:
                    - Delete `/src/jsscomponents/Styleguide*` and `/src/components/GraphQL*`
                    - Delete `/sitecore/definitions/components/Styleguide*`, `/sitecore/definitions/templates/Styleguide*`, and `/sitecore/definitions/components/GraphQL*`
                    - Delete `/data/component-content/Styleguide`
                    - Delete `/data/content/Styleguide`
                    - Delete `/data/routes/styleguide` and `/data/routes/graphql`
                    - Delete `/data/dictionary/*.yml`
